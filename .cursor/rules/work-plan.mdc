# Work Plan Generator

For creating a comprehensive step-by-step work plan to build a prototype, given a project brief.

## Instructions

When generating a work plan:

- Analyze the project brief thoroughly to identify all required features, components, and functionality
- Break down the project into logical phases: setup, core functionality, UI/UX development, testing, and deployment
- Generate a detailed step-by-step to-do list with each task being no larger than 1 story point 
- Ensure steps follow the logical development flow a developer would take to build the prototype
- Include both technical and design considerations for each phase
- Identify potential dependencies between tasks and sequence accordingly
- Reference [scaffold-project.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/scaffold-project.mdc) for specific project scaffolding steps 
- Include steps for project documentation and developer handoff if applicable
- Identify opportunities for incremental delivery of functionality
