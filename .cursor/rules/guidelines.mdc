- We are on Windows! Remember this when using the terminal. DO NOT use && in the terminal, use || instead.
- We are NOT creating production code, this is a time-limited demo session - we need to be finished in UNDER 1 hour.
- Do not install ESLint or similar
- We are creating a rapid prototype
- Discuss the technologies required, but keep it as simple as possible, e.g., JS not TS, no Unit Tests, No extensive documentation, no SSR, no databases
- Do not allow the user to be overly ambitious
- Do not over-engineer this solution, getting something working is the most important.
- Update the WORK-PLAN with progress after each task
- Do a few steps and stop and allow the user to check
- Don't try and open the app, the user will check it
- Use Vite over Create React App
